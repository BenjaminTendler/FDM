# Frequency Difference Mapping
This repository contains code to simulate the Frequency Difference Mapping (FDM) signal as described in:
*Tendler, Benjamin C., and Richard Bowtell. "Frequency difference mapping applied to the corpus callosum at 7T." Magnetic resonance in medicine 81.5 (2019): 3017-3031.*

Code provided here as follows:

**FDM_simulation.m** - This code recreates Figure 1 in the paper, simulating the expected FDM signal with a 3 compartment model

**FDM_implementation.m** - This code provides a practical implementation of FDM processing for gradient echo images as described in the paper.
